Every AIpkg package has an **ID** — a globally unique, immutable string that identifies the package across all versions. This document defines the normative rules for package IDs and display names.

---

## Package ID Syntax

A package ID must conform to the following rules:

- **Pattern:** `^[a-z][a-z0-9\-\.]{0,127}$`
- **Max length:** 128 characters
- **First character:** lowercase ASCII letter (`a`–`z`)
- **Remaining characters:** lowercase ASCII letters, digits (`0`–`9`), hyphens (`-`), or dots (`.`)
- **Case:** all lowercase; uppercase is never accepted

### Allowed Characters

| Character class | Allowed |
|-----------------|---------|
| Lowercase letters `a`–`z` | Yes |
| Digits `0`–`9` | Yes |
| Hyphen `-` | Yes |
| Dot `.` | Yes |
| Uppercase letters `A`–`Z` | No |
| Underscore `_` | No |
| Spaces | No |
| Any non-ASCII character | No |

---

## Forbidden Patterns

Even if the character set is valid, the following patterns are rejected:

| Pattern | Example | Reason |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Leading separator | `-my-tool`, `.my-tool` | Must start with a letter |
| Trailing separator | `my-tool-`, `my-tool.` | Clean boundary |
| Consecutive hyphens | `my--tool` | Reserved for future scoping syntax |
| Consecutive dots | `my..tool` | Ambiguous hierarchy |
| Single character | `a`, `x` | Too short to be meaningful |

---

## Reserved IDs

The following IDs (and IDs matching these prefixes) are permanently reserved and cannot be registered:

| Reserved | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| `aipkg`, `aipkg-*`, `aipkg.*` | Registry-owned namespace |
| `test`, `example`, `sample` | Commonly used for demos; reserved to prevent pollution |
| `api`, `admin`, `null`, `undefined`, `system`, `root` | System words that conflict with registry routes or tooling |

A push attempting to use a reserved ID receives `400 Bad Request` with error code `ID_RESERVED`.

---

## Publisher Scoping Conventions

AIpkg does not enforce namespacing at the syntax level — there is no `@scope/name` mechanism. Instead, publishers use two conventions:

### Prefix convention

Use a consistent prefix separated by a hyphen:

```
acme-git-helpers
acme-code-review
acme-typescript
```

### Dot-group convention

Use dots to create an implicit hierarchy:

```
acme.tools.git
acme.tools.typescript
acme.core
```

Both conventions are just that — conventions. The registry does not parse or enforce them. Enforcement happens through **prefix reservations** (see [Prefix Reservations](04-prefix-reservations)), which give verified publishers exclusive use of a prefix.

---

## Display Names vs IDs

| Property | Field | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Canonical identifier | `id` | Immutable; used in all API calls and URLs |
| Human-readable label | `title` | Optional; shown in UI; no character restrictions except max 256 chars |

If `title` is absent, the UI falls back to displaying `id`.

**Examples:**

| `id` | `title` |
|------|---------|
| `git-helpers` | "Git Helper Skills" |
| `acme.tools.git` | "Acme Git Toolkit" |
| `filesystem-mcp` | "Filesystem MCP Server" |

---

## ID Immutability and Transfer

Once a package version is published:

- The `id` **cannot be changed** — it is permanent for the life of the package
- The `id` **cannot be reused** after a package is deleted — deleted IDs are tombstoned and permanently reserved
- ID ownership can be **transferred** between registry accounts via a registry team support request

### Tombstone Policy

When a package is deleted (not just unlisted), its ID is permanently reserved. A subsequent push with the same ID from any account receives `409 Conflict` with error code `ID_TOMBSTONED`.

This prevents dependency confusion attacks where a deleted package ID is re-registered with malicious content.

---

## Validation Error Codes

The following error codes are returned by the registry and by `AipkgValidator` (see [SDK Interface](10-sdk-interface)):

| Code | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| `ID_INVALID_PATTERN` | ID does not match `^[a-z][a-z0-9\-\.]{0,127}$` |
| `ID_TOO_LONG` | ID exceeds 128 characters |
| `ID_RESERVED` | ID matches a system-reserved pattern |
| `ID_FORBIDDEN_PATTERN` | ID contains `--`, `..`, leading/trailing separator, or single character |
| `ID_TOMBSTONED` | ID was previously registered and deleted |
| `ID_PREFIX_CONFLICT` | ID uses a reserved prefix owned by another publisher |
