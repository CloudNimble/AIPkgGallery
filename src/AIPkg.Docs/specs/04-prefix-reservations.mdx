Prefix reservations give verified publishers the exclusive right to publish packages whose IDs begin with a specific prefix. This prevents impersonation and establishes clear ownership boundaries for ecosystems of related packages.

---

## What It Is

A prefix reservation associates a package ID prefix with a verified registry account. Once reserved:

- Only the owning account (and accounts they delegate to) may push packages whose IDs start with the prefix
- Packages from the owning account display a **verified badge** on search cards and detail pages
- Packages from unverified accounts whose IDs start with the prefix are **quarantined** (push is accepted but package is held pending review)

Prefix reservations are analogous to NuGet.org's [prefix reservation feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/id-prefix-reservation).

## Prefix Syntax Rules

A valid prefix must:

- End in `-` or `.` (the terminating separator)
- Be at least **3 characters** long (including the separator)
- Match the package ID character set: `[a-z][a-z0-9\-\.]*` followed by `-` or `.`
- Not be a prefix of an already-reserved prefix owned by another account (no nesting conflicts)

**Valid examples:**

| Prefix | Packages it covers |
|--------|--------------------|
| `acme-` | `acme-tools`, `acme-git-helpers`, `acme-mcp` |
| `acme.` | `acme.core`, `acme.tools.git` |
| `openai-` | `openai-tools`, `openai-plugins` |

**Invalid examples:**

| Prefix | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| `ac-` | Too short (less than 3 chars before separator) |
| `acme` | Does not end in `-` or `.` |
| `ACME-` | Uppercase not permitted |

## How to Claim a Prefix

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit a request">
    Fill out the prefix reservation form in the registry UI at `/account/prefix-reservations/new`. Provide:
    - The desired prefix
    - Your GitHub organization or user handle
    - A brief justification (e.g., "We maintain the official Acme MCP integrations")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manual review">
    The registry team reviews the request. Approval criteria:
    - The prefix clearly maps to the requester's published identity or project
    - The requester already owns (or intends to publish) packages under the prefix
    - No existing packages from other accounts would be retroactively quarantined
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reservation active">
    Once approved, the prefix is active. The account receives a notification, and their existing packages under that prefix gain the verified badge immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Verified Badge

Packages from verified prefix owners display a shield badge (✓) on:
- Search result cards
- Package detail page headers
- The `verified: true` field in search API responses

The badge tooltip shows: *"Verified publisher: {account}"*

---

## What Reservation Does NOT Do

Prefix reservations provide **registry-level** ownership, not legal protection:

- **No trademark protection** — A reservation does not grant intellectual property rights. Trademark disputes are handled outside the registry.
- **No domain verification** — Claiming `acme-` does not verify that you own `acme.com`.
- **No retroactive cleanup** — Packages from other accounts that predate the reservation are not deleted. They are quarantined only if a new push arrives after the reservation is active.
- **No subdomain enforcement** — Reserving `acme-` does not cover `my-acme-tool` (the prefix must appear at the start of the ID).

---

## Transfer and Release Policy

### Transfer

Transferring a prefix reservation to another account requires registry team involvement. Both the current owner and the receiving account must confirm the transfer via email.

### Voluntary Release

An owner may release a reservation voluntarily by submitting a request via the registry UI. Released prefixes become available for anyone to claim after a **30-day cooling period**.

### Revocation

The registry team may revoke a reservation for:
- **Abuse** — using the prefix to impersonate another project or distribute malicious packages
- **24-month inactivity** — no packages published under the prefix for 24 consecutive months, with no response to a warning email within 30 days

---

## Registry API

There is **no public endpoint** for prefix reservation management at MVP. The `verified` boolean in search results and registration blobs is set server-side and is not directly queryable.

```json
{
  "id": "acme-git-helpers",
  "verified": true,
  ...
}
```

Future versions of the API may expose `GET /v3/prefixes/{prefix}` to query reservation status.
