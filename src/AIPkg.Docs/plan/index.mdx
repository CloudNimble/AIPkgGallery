title: "Implementation Plan"
description: "How the AIpkg build team constructs AIpkg.org by transforming NuGetGallery — tech stack decisions, project structure, data layer, frontend, server, SDK, docs, and migration phases."

---

This section is for the **AIpkg build team**. It assumes NuGetGallery as the starting point and documents every decision about how we build and migrate to AIpkg.org. A third-party implementer building a compatible registry does not need this section — see the [Specifications](../specs/index) instead.

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Goal | Key Deliverable |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| **0** | Clean SLNX solution, SQL DB project, EasyAF scaffolding | `dotnet build AIpkg.slnx` succeeds |
| **1** | Core Registry API, push/download/registration, auth, `AIpkg.Core` | Package round-trip works |
| **2** | Search + catalog pipeline (Azure AI Search) | Packages appear in search after push |
| **3** | Blazor web UI | Full browser experience |
| **4** | `aipkg` CLI MVP (Native AOT) | Single-binary install/push/search |

## Quick Reference: What Stays vs. What Goes

| NuGetGallery Component | AIpkg Fate |
|------------------------|------------|
| V3 API logic (push, download, registration, search) | **Keep & adapt** — new schemas, new field names |
| V2/OData API | **Delete** |
| OWIN / Autofac / Razor views | **Delete** |
| Symbol package support | **Delete** — not applicable |
| Azure Blob storage abstraction | **Keep & adapt** — rename `.nupkg` → `.aipkg` |
| Azure AI Search integration | **Keep & adapt** — new document model |
| CDN stats parsing jobs | **Keep & adapt** — `.aipkg` download events |
| GitHub OAuth + PBKDF2 API keys | **Keep & port** — no structural changes |
| `NuGetGallery.sln` (139 projects) | **Do not convert** — new `AIpkg.slnx` from scratch |

---

## Guiding Principles for Implementation

1. **New SLNX, not converted solution** — `AIpkg.slnx` is created from scratch; NuGetGallery projects are ported, not referenced.
2. **EasyAF owns the data layer** — `.sqlproj` is schema source of truth; no hand-written EF migrations.
3. **Blazor SSR only** — no Razor views, no jQuery, no OWIN. Static SSR for public pages, Interactive Server for authenticated flows.
4. **AOT-safe code** — `AIpkg.Core` must be AOT compatible; no reflection emit or dynamic code.
5. **Port, don't preserve** — NuGetGallery source is a reference, not a constraint. Strip aggressively.
